JS8Spotter Quick Help

# Main Program
## Main Window

    * Create and select profiles to organize your search terms
        - If "Background Scan" is checked, your profile search terms will scan at all times
        - If "Background Scan" is unchecked, your profile search terms will only scan
          if/when you are viewing that profile

    * On the left are your custom search terms
        - Add search terms individually using the entry box, or in bulk using "Import"
        - Export search terms as needed, to share or backup

    * On the right you will see activity that matches your search terms
        - Export or clear as needed

    * Double-click entries in the left or right tree to see details of that entry

## Settings

    * The File>Settings menu will allow you to set your callsign and grid,
      as well as modify TCP settings as needed

# Tools Menu
## Using the Map(s)

    * Set your grid location in the File>Settings menu
    * Double-click on a callsign to highlight its location on the map
    * If your map is too crowded, lower the number of stations displayed
    * Use the <Delete> key to remove stations from the list/map, or select and right-click
    * The map is updated only when loaded from the menu, or when an item is deleted
    * Locations are approximate

## Expect Subsystem

    The Expect system looks for custom commands, and sends custom replies.

    * Command Format: Sending station <A> might send the following to station <B>
        - "<A>: <B> E? <expected command>" for example, "N6CYB: KF7MIX E? CMDS"
        - If I have an Expect entry for the command "CMDS", the reply I have stored would be
          auto-transmitted

    * Fields:
        - Expect Text: The text that you station is waiting to see, before sending the reply
        - Reply Text: What your station will TX after encountering the expected text
        - Reply-To List: A list of comma separated callsigns or @groups that can trigger a reply
        - Max Replies: The number of times a reply can be triggered for this expected text

    * Use the <Delete> key to remove entries from the list
    * Right-click to edit an entry
    * Double-click to view details of an entry
    * The Send Now button will let you TX an expect entry manually
    * MCForms filled-out forms are posted as expect entries

## MCForms Subsystem

    The MCForms system adds basic multiple choice forms functionality to JS8Call. Please
    see the forms/ folder and associated text files, along with the README.txt file included
    with this program for details and information.

## APRS Commands

    The built-in APRS commands will format the proper JS8Call string to transmit
    an APRS command to a listening station. With these you may:

    * Send an SMS text message (maximum of 32 characters)
    * Send an email
    * Report your grid location to the APRS network
